## Description

get_next_line is a project from the 42 Common Core curriculum. It involves implementing a utility function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time. it can also handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously. It's very usefull in C project in 42 curriculum.

As part of the 42 curriculum, this project comes with strict coding guidelines:
- The standard C library is forbidden, requiring the use of custom code for all tasks.
- A strict rule of 5 functions per file and 25 lines per function is enforced.
- There are restrictions such as no assignments on the same line and a focus on clean, maintainable code.

### Purpose

The get_next_line function works similarly to std::getline in C++, allowing you to read input line by line from a file descriptor. However, unlike std::getline, you are responsible for freeing the returned memory yourself. The function reads characters until a newline (\n) or null terminator (\0) is encountered.

### Technologies used

- C language.
- Make.

### Challenges and Future Features

One of the main challenges in this project was understanding how static variables work in C and how they can be used to retain state between function calls. Managing memory efficiently and handling multiple file descriptors were also key learning points.

Iâ€™m not planning to add any new features at this time.

## Installation

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) or [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
```bash
clang --version
gcc --version
```
- Ensure you have installed [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to build the project
```bash
make --version
```

## Run

The files get_next_line.c and get_next_line_bonus.c are identical. I have uploaded the same file under two different names to accommodate the requirements of 'Moulinette', an algorithm that automatically grades our projects.

1. **Include the library in your project**: Add the following line at the top of your source code files:
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

2. **Compile your project**: When compiling your project, you can give a buffer size. Here's an example:
```bash
clang -D BUFFER_SIZE=1024 your_program.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o your_project_name
```
